def main():
    '''Given an input folder of client circpadtrace files generated by 
    torlog2circpadtrace.py, transforms them to different formats suitable for
    Website Fingerprinting (WF) classifiers. 

    Supported output formats (one of): 
    - Cells, each line only contains 1 or -1 for outgoing or incoming cells.
    - TimeCells, relative timestamp (ms) added before each cell.
    - DirectionalTime, each line has relative time multiplied with cell value.

    The Cells format is the most commonly used, while TimeCells adds time, and
    DirectionalTime is the format used by Rahman et al. in Tik-Tok.

    Timestamps are taken directly from the client's trace. This is way too
    optimistic for an attacker, because it's much closer to Tor Browser's
    (Firefox's) internal processing than any network attacker would get. Because
    of this, by default, we add some random noise to the timestamps. We strongly
    encourage you to think twice about disabling this, results will likely be
    too optimistic if your attack uses time.

    If a relay folder is provided with the corresponding relay traces, the
    timestamp calculation is changed to as advantageous as we can make them to
    the attacker. This will be stronger than the typical WF attacker that only
    observes network traffic at one location, e.g., at a guard or middle relay,
    or at client's ISP. For cells sent,
